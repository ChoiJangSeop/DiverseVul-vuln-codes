	 * years backwards from the current July.  (Weekly resolution is good
	 * enough to identify DST transition rules, since everybody switches on
	 * Sundays.)  This is sufficient to cover most of the Unix time_t range,
	 * and we don't want to look further than that since many systems won't
	 * have sane TZ behavior further back anyway.  The further back the zone
	 * matches, the better we score it.  This may seem like a rather random
	 * way of doing things, but experience has shown that system-supplied
	 * timezone definitions are likely to have DST behavior that is right for
	 * the recent past and not so accurate further back. Scoring in this way
	 * allows us to recognize zones that have some commonality with the Olson
	 * database, without insisting on exact match. (Note: we probe Thursdays,
	 * not Sundays, to avoid triggering DST-transition bugs in localtime
